  ## Description
   Every project needs a README.md file that contains clear information about the app. The README file guides the user about what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it.
   
   This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on user input. Check out the [file](#readme_generated.md) in this repo as an example.
